Show a slide show of header that can be controlled from a page on a different browser (like a phone)

You'd use this by placing the terminal below the header and starting a screen capture around just the terminal and the header. You can then change headers from the control url on a phone, keeping the terminal in focus the whole time.

## Important URL's
- `0.0.0.0:5000` - Page to display the headers
- `0.0.0.0:5000/control` - Buttons to change the header being shown
